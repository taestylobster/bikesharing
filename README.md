# Overview of statistical analysis
The purpose of this analysis was to use CitiBike data for August of 2019 in New York City to assist with determining
if a similar business could be effective in Des Moines, Iowa. Then creating an easy to consume tableau dashboard that
the sales person can use when presenting to investors.

# Summary
The CitiBike program in New York City seems to appeal to many people and mostly individuals living in or around the city based upon
the high ratio of subscribers to customers. It is also interesting to notice that the busiest times are during weekdays when typical
worker are going to work or coming home from work. I believe there is a lot of potential for this program in other cities like Des Moines.
- I would suggest looking at average distance used for the top stations.
- I would also suggest looking at where bikes end up to determine if they need to be relocated during off hours to suit demand.
